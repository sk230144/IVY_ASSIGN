Setting up and Running the Node.js Application Locally


Prerequisites:
Node.js installed on your local machine.
MongoDB installed and running locally.


Steps:
Clone or download the repository containing the Node.js application code.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Install the dependencies by running the following command:


npm install
Start the Node.js server by running the following command:

npm start
This will start the server on the default port 3000.


Interacting with the API Endpoints
Using Postman:
Open Postman application.
Set the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the desired endpoint.
Enter the API URL for the endpoint you want to interact with (e.g., http://localhost:3000/api/users).
If necessary, set request headers or request body based on the endpoint requirements.
Click on the "Send" button to make the request.
View the response from the server in the Postman interface.


Using curl (Command Line):
Open a terminal window.
Use the appropriate curl command with the desired HTTP method and API URL.
Example for GET request:
bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
Example for POST request:
json
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "johndoe@example.com", "age": 30}' http://localhost:3000/api/users
Press Enter to execute the curl command.
View the response from the server in the terminal output.
